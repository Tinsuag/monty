to this project we need the knowledge of Argc and Argv




	1. create a c program that accepts a file as an argument
	
	for this project we need to take 2  arguments:
		1 for the command
		2 for the folder for the bytecode
	so the code we put in must be exactly 2 otherwise we should throw an error message

	2. check if the file can be accessed and open the file

	once the the code is in order we have to check it if the file requested is accessable
	if you can't access it, then throw an error but if you can it then move on to the next step.

	3. Open the file

no we can access the file we can go ahead and open the file.
